The surging population ever increasing the need for defined legal codes and processes has lead Charlameme and Orinnari to spend the majority of their time over the past few days discussing and debating on what should and should most certaintly not be included in this new Constitution, as while it does carry over many of the amendments from its predecessor, it was written in the early days of Southshire by Orinnari and therefore did not include anything about justice or pearling. The Council were kept abreast of each change they made and how it would impact Southshire, and is now being published.

***[Read the Constitution](../second-constitution/)***

To summarise, the Council will remain but will largely deal with laws, their implementation, and their enforcement, while newly created entities will handle justice and executive power. Eddie (StrPlatinum) will move laterally into the executive position of Chancellor, opening up his seat for another. It also enforces a monthly refresh of the Council as well as expanding on Citizen's rights, among other things.
