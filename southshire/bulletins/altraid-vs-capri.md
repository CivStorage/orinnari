After the fracas between AltRaid and Capri, an official statement has been released by Orinnari that
attempts to be a faithful retelling of the events, [which you can read here.](../altraid-vs-capri/)
The result is that AltRaid will continue to be banned for a previous transgression, although may still 
use our rail network. Although any attempt to *test* what is considered leaving the train station will 
not be tolerated. Capri on the other hand has been outright banned from Southshire, and so may not 
enter under any circumstances, or otherwise will be considered pearl on sight.
