The pearling of Crimeo by AltRaid, which happened before [the facas between AltRaid and Capri,](./altraid-vs-capri.html) 
caused an almost immediate ban by StrPlatinum via [Casual Powers.](../parliamentary-powers/) 
However, after an official statement was released by Orinnari, [which you can read here.](../altraid-vs-crimeo/), 
Parliament voted unanimously to sentence AltRaid to three hours community service, and that 
until he completes it, is banned from entering Southshire, although may still use our rail network.
