Parliament has voted unanimously to dissolve the Constitution, so that it no longer holds 
any legal legitimacy. All power is now held by Parliament as it was originally before power was 
split between three branches of government. However, Parliament may choose to follow the 
Constitution as guidelines at its discretion.
