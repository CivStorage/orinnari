An account of how Tabby, a citizen and trusted member of the Commonwealth at the time, hired a bounty hunter to find and or track DurianSmash, a new friend at the time accused of having griefed Tabbyâ€™s basement, and was invited to live within Southshire.

At the time of the incident, DurianSmash had not built within Southshire. He would eventually build a house within the plot indicated below:

On Sunday 2nd July 2017 a player named Zayshi entered Southshire and began acting ominously.

```
[22:27] DurianSmash: who is zayshi
[22:28] DurianSmash: Why does he have facatory access

[22:30] UNKNOWN: dunno but people were talking to him earlier

[22:33] DurianSmash: He is attacking

[22:42] Orinnari: You said Zayshi is attacking, right?
[22:42] Orinnari: He's in Southshire

```
[22:43] Siriann: There's a gerfer going around?

[22:43] Orinnari: Apparently

[22:44] MiloY: whats the name?

[22:44] Orinnari: Zayshi

[22:44] Tabby: he's not a griefer
[22:44] Tabby: he's a bounty hunter, he has a house in town
[22:44] Tabby: he's after durian cause I bountied him

[22:44] Orinnari: So if I went outside, he won't kill me?
[22:46] Orinnari: Could you ask your bounty hunter to leave Southshire?

[22:47] Tabby: depends, are you gonna stop defending griefers?

[22:48] Orinnari: Great, so you're actually griefing me

[22:48] Tabby: I would never grief

[22:48] Orinnari: You're a small, petty little human, aren't you?

[22:48] Tabby: I do send bounty hunters after people who grief me though

[22:48] Orinnari: Considering your bounty hunter is now placing dirt in front of my windows.

[22:49] Tabby: well, he never pearled durian, just killed him over and over again

[22:49] Orinnari: He is refusing to leave Soutshire, and is actively placing blocks

[22:49] UNKNOWN: what gear is he wearing orinnari?

[22:49] Orinnari: He said "haha pranked"

[22:49] DurianSmash: Please get him and return my armor and glass
[22:49] DurianSmash: He has all d, not enchanted

[22:49] Orinnari: He's wearing diamond armour, not enchanted

[22:50] DurianSmash: is he logged in?

[22:50] Orinnari: Yup, he's still here

[22:50] DurianSmash: where

[22:50] Tabby: if durian says he won't grief my house again I'll tell him the bounty's dropped

[22:51] DurianSmash: I won't. But you can't let raiders go all over
[22:51] DurianSmash: And he even has WC access.

[22:51] Orinnari: He's wandering around, going through my chests
[22:51] Orinnari: actively and deliberately placing blocks

[22:51] Tabby: yeah, he's a citizen
[22:51] Tabby: he lives in town

[22:51] MiloY: i dont think this constitutes as a 'raider'

[22:52] Orinnari: Never said he was a raider

[22:52] Tabby: it doesn't, he just kills people for money

[22:52] DurianSmash: Someone remove him please
[22:52] DurianSmash: orrinari, where is he?

[22:53] Orinnari: He's in Southshire.

[22:55] DurianSmash: I'm gonna get my diamond stoff out to kill him

[22:56] Orinnari: He has logged

[22:57] Lodish: why was he pestering Orinnari?

[22:57] Orinnari: Well
[22:58] Orinnari: Tabby said she would call him off if I "stopped defending griefers"
[22:58] Orinnari: And he is attacking me

[22:58] Tabby: I did call him off

[22:58] Orinnari: I just asked him whether he left
[22:58] Orinnari: He said yes, and he's still here
[22:58] Orinnari: And has attacked me
[22:59] Orinnari: Obviously he respects your commands.

[22:59] MiloY: out of the blue attacked?

[22:59] Orinnari: Yup

[22:59] specificlanguage: are we still bounty hunting the bounty hunter

[22:59] DurianSmash: Yes
[22:59] DurianSmash: he has my stuff

```
[23:00] Lodish: so.... there's no bounties now right?

[23:00] Tabby: nope
[23:01] Tabby: I dropped durian's because he promised not build under my house again
[23:02] Tabby: orrinari never had one to start with, I just said he might try stuff if durian was pearled
[23:02] Tabby: guess he bounty hunted a little strong
[23:02] Tabby: hopefully all good
[23:02] Tabby: he should be giving you stuff as reps for griefing your house
[23:02] Tabby: I yelled a little
[23:03] Tabby: apologies

[23:03] Orinnari: His "reps" are going to despawn.
[23:03] Orinnari: I did not want his reparations. I wanted him to leave.
[23:04] Orinnari: But your vendetta against a "griefer" had brought all this on.

[23:04] Tabby: has he not left?

[23:05] Orinnari: I believe so. He is not in the town centre anymore, but whether he's still in Southshire is... I dun

[23:05] Tabby: he should be gone

[23:05] Orinnari: Good.

[23:05] Tabby: you dont' have a bounty, and he was only meant to be watching you anyway
[23:05] Tabby: hence the reps

[23:05] Orinnari: You set someone to watch me?
[23:05] Orinnari: Excuse me, what the actual fuck?

[23:05] Tabby: yeah you defended griefers
[23:06] Tabby: figured you might be gearing him

[23:06] Orinnari: You sent someone 1000 blocks to watch me?

[23:06] Tabby: I take lawbreaking very seriously

[23:06] Orinnari: Wow, you arebatshit.
[23:06] Orinnari: You and your "bountyhunter" are not welcome inside the bounds of Southshore.
[23:06] Orinnari: Southshire*

[23:07] Tabby: you'll have to tell him yourself
[23:07] Tabby: as you can see, I have very lax control

[23:07] Orinnari: Haha
[23:07] Orinnari: Seeimg he is hired by you
[23:07] Orinnari: To literally surveil me
[23:07] Orinnari: I'm so glad I left the Capital
